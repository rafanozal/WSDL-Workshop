remark: Web Service Interaction Ontology (WSIO) enables automated interaction with more complex Web services that are typical for example within life sciences. WSIO is however independent of the application domain and relevant for any SOAP Web services. If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO will enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios. WSIO aims to serve also as a means to standardise the complex interaction scenarios within SOAP Web services.

! If we would be agnostic to the doctrine of a bipolar world with a clear and never-changing border between types/classes/universals and instances/particulars/individuals, or between the domain (of subjects) of every semantic annotation and its range (of objects), we should start using a type of relation in the sense of the following:
[Typedef]
id: WSIO_relation:is
name: is
subset: Relation
uri: http://wsio.org/relation/is
def: "'A is B' or 'A is a B' defines for the subject A, that it is a specialisation of, exact equivalent of, or conceptually belonging to, the object B." [WSIO, http://wsio.org]
comment: Subject A can either be any ontology concept (ontological category), or any entity outside of an ontology (or an ontology concept in a role of an entity being semantically annotated).\nB can either be any ontology concept (category), or (rarely) an entity outside of an ontology (only if A is an entity, or in a role of an entity, being semantically annotated).\nNote a deviation from linguistics: 'is_a/is' should not be used for properties having a value or entities having properties (e.g. 'Name is Jon', 'Car is red') - these should be denoted by 'The subject has name Jon' or 'Name has value Jon', and 'Car has colour red'. 'Colour is red' is wrong and 'Red is (a) colour' is a proper use of 'is_a'/'is'.\n\nIn the scope of WSIO, 'is' is only for relating annotated entities outside of WSIO with 'Data' concepts. WSIO uses the 'OBO_REL:is_a' instead of 'is' for the specialisation relation between WSIO concepts to enable interoperability with tools supporting the OBO format (a semantic compromise).
synonym: "is a" EXACT [WSIO, http://wsio.org] ! 'EXACT' if we don't play with the grammar & semantics of articles.
synonym: "is_a" NARROW [OBO_REL:is_a] ! Its 'EXACT' synonym 'is_subtype_of' sounds like limiting both the domain and range to entities or concepts that are some kind of types. We however use the 'OBO_REL:is_a' instead of 'is' for the specialisation relation between WSIO concepts to enable interoperability with tools supporting the OBO format (a semantic compromise).
synonym: "instance_of" NARROW [OBO_REL:instance_of] ! Limiting to subjects that are some kind of instances. (IF tools are supporting 'instance_of' (annotation statements in what format?) we suggest using it as a semantic compromise instead of 'is', when relating an entity as belonging to a concept.)
